### Chapter 1: Creating Tickets
1.	Return to the osTicket page to where osTicket was just installed and click on the <b>Your osTicket URL:</b> link or enter http://localhost/osTicket/ into the address bar to get sent to the Support Center. Once there, click on <b>Open a New Ticket</b>.

2.	Enter the same contact information entered in Chapter 2, Bullet 2 of the <a href="https://github.com/Rashon5/osticket-install">osTicket: Installation & Virtual Machine Creation</a> suppository. We made users Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to use for this step. Enter an email address and full name of the user and select a help topic.

    Once the help topic is selected, enter an Issue Summary, or a subject to the ticket. In the message box, explain and describe the details of the issue, and once         done, click on <b>Create Ticket</b>.

3.	Navigate back to the Agent Panel under Tickets > Open on osTicket, refresh the page, and the newly created ticket should show up. Click on the newly created ticket to see all the options.

4.	Find and click on Assigned To: to choose which agent to assign the ticket to. For this example, we will assign the ticket to ourselves.

5.	Click on SLA Plan: to classify an SLA to the ticket based on the perceived severity and urgency.

6.	The video above repeats the above steps to create more tickets, as well as checking what other agents see as tickets get assigned to them

### Chapter 2: Resolving Tickets
1.	After reading the ticket information, enter a reply back to the ticket issuer depending on how well the ticket can be handled at the current moment. If it can be resolved, type a reply and click on Post Reply. After that, move down to Ticket Status: and change the dropdown to Resolved. Upon looking at Ticket > Closed, the solved ticket will appear.

Those are the basics! Good luck in your help desk journey!
