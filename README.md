2.	Enter the same contact information entered in Chapter 2, Bullet 2 of the <a href="https://github.com/Rashon5/osticket-install">osTicket: Installation & Virtual     Machine Creation</a> suppository. We made users Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to use for this step. Enter an email address and full name of the user and select a help topic.

    Once the help topic is selected, enter an Issue Summary, or a subject to the ticket. In the message box, explain and describe the details of the issue, and once         done, click on <b>Create Ticket</b>.

6.	<i>The video above repeats the above steps to create more tickets, as well as checking what other agents see as tickets get assigned to them</i>

### Chapter 2: Resolving Tickets
1.	After reading the ticket information, enter a reply back to the ticket issuer depending on how well the ticket can be handled at the current moment. If it can be resolved, type a reply and click on Post Reply. After that, move down to Ticket Status: and change the dropdown to Resolved. Upon looking at Ticket > Closed, the solved ticket will appear.
